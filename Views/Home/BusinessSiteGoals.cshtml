    <h4>When a potential customer browses to your website they make a few quick decisions:</h4>
    <p>It takes less than 0.2 seconds for someone to form a first impression of your website, according to a study done by the <a href="http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/thesis/Eyes_dont_lie_unde_09007dcc80993a1e.html">Missouri University of Science and Technology</a>.  This means that a user is likely to judge how friendly and trustworthy your company is almost instantly when browsing to your presence on the internet (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=501173">citation</a>).  We all know what happens when we don’t feel comfortable with a business we are dealing with - we don’t buy anything and we leave.</p>

    <p>Leaving is exactly what your customers are likely to do if your internet presence is reminiscent of an old run-down store in a bad part of town.  The goal of your website needs to be clear in your mind- it can be an extra salesmen working around the clock to help gain clients, or it can be a bum standing outside scaring off your prospects.</p>

    <p>An effective website design that facilitates a user’s browsing behavior is necessary to create a good user experience when someone is using your website (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422306000366">citation</a>).  With proper understanding of your business’ needs, a website can be designed to help assist the progress of a user through your website in a manner that is welcoming to them.  Just like a physical store’s presentation can guide a customer exactly where they want to be, your website can, and should, do the same.</p>

    <h4 class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Review the design process with you</a></h4>
    <div class="acc-container">
        <div class="content">
        <p>Typical website design companies don’t offer logo design or even content service.  You ask for a website and you are required to provide a logo and all your content.  We do not require you to have any content ready to go - we can do as little or as much as you want as far as the design of the website and its content, and we will work closely with you to ensure that you fully approve of the design of the entire website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sit down and sketch out logos, if necessary</li>
            <li>Offer multiple layout options / structures for the website</li>
            <li>Describe technical needs in layman's terms as necessary / desired</li>
        </ul>

    <h4 class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Development process</a></h4>
    <div class="acc-container">
        <div class="content">
        <p>Above all else we pay attention to details.  Every detail of your website will be put into place with thought of accessibility and functionality.  We pride ourselves on our ability to make aesthetically pleasing and highly functional websites.</p>
        <p>During this time we will perform all necessary design, coding, deployment preparations needed to get the website to a fully functional and desirable state.</p>
        <p>The actual development process can take a varying amount of time that would depend on what exactly you wanted the website to be.  As development progresses we will keep you up-to-date and let you experience the website as it grows.</p>

        <p>We will get the website fully operational either at its new location or in place of a previous website.  The functionality and features will be reviewed and any necessary final polishing touches that need to be done will be performed with the goal of having the website just as you desire.</p>
